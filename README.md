# london_no2_analysis
A series of scripts for analysing air pollution data from London

# Summary
There is a large amount of data available which records how air pollutants like ozone, nitrogen dioxide and particulate matter have been evolving across London over the past. 
These measurements can be easily accessed using the marvelous OpenAir package in R and this script attempts to help bring together the data as one large data.frame. 

# Usage
The script needs R installed and the openair and plyr libraries installed. It also requires a connection to the internet as the main openair functions querry servers which host the data.
