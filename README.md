# london_no2_analysis
A series of scripts for analysing air pollution data from London

# Summary
There is a large amount of data available which records how air pollutants like ozone, nitrogen dioxide and particulate matter have been evolving across London over the past. 
These measurements can be easily accessed using the marvelous OpenAir package in R and this script attempts to help bring together the data as one large data.frame.
